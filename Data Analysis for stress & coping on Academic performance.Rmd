# Introduction

The primary objective of this project is to explore how **demographic factors** (such as age, gender, family structure, etc.), **Stress** and **coping mechanisms**, and their combined impact influence **Academic performance**. The aim is to understand how these factors might contribute to or hinder a student’s ability to succeed academically.

By gathering data on these elements, the study will uncover patterns that can offer insights to answer the following Questions:

- **Family Background**: How does family structure (e.g., single-parent families, dual-parent families) influence stress and academic performance?
- **Educational Level**: Does a student's level of education (high school, undergraduate, etc.) impact their stress levels and coping strategies?
- **Access to Resources**: How do factors like digital access contribute to a student's success?

- **Stress Levels**: What types of stress do students experience, and how do they perceive their stress level in relation to their studies?
- **Coping Strategies**: What coping mechanisms are most commonly employed by students, and how do these mechanisms influence their academic outcomes?

- **Interaction of Factors**: How do demographic factors (e.g., family background, age) interact with stress levels and coping strategies to influence academic performance?
- **Academic Success or Failure**: How do these combined factors contribute to a student's ability to succeed academically, and what patterns can be identified?

# Data Analysis
Below, we will present a summary of the data and apply statistical analysis techniques such as confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, regression analysis to interpret the data.

# Confidence Interval (CI)
A confidence interval is used to estimate a range of values that is likely to contain the population parameter. For example, if we want to estimate the mean GPA of all students based on a sample,we would calculate the confidence interval for **the Sample mean GPA**.

```{r}

# Point Estimate for the population mean (GPA for All student in college)
Estimated_population_mean = mean(data_cleaned$GPA)
Estimated_population_mean 


# 1- 95% Confidence Interval for GPA
confidence_level <- 0.95
z_value <- qnorm(1 - (1 - confidence_level) / 2)  # z=1.96 for 95% CI
z_value

# Calculate margin of error
n = length(data_cleaned$GPA)
margin_of_error <- z_value * (sd(data_cleaned$GPA) / sqrt(n))

# Calculate confidence interval
CI_lower <- Estimated_population_mean - margin_of_error
CI_upper <- Estimated_population_mean + margin_of_error
CI = c(CI_lower, CI_upper)
CI

```
- This means we are 95% confident that the true population mean GPA lies between **5.259 and 6.818**.
- The margin of error is 0.780 (rounded), indicating **the estimate's precision**. As smaller margin of error suggests more precision in the estimate of the population mean of GPA.

# Hypothesis Testing
We'll conduct hypothesis tests to validate or reject assumptions about the data. 

- Test Conducted: One-sample z-test on the GPA variable to determine if the true mean of GPA is significantly different from 2.
# Case (1)- Two Sided
- Null Hypothesis (H₀): The true mean GPA is equal to 2.
- Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): The true mean GPA is not equal to 2.

```{r}
#install.packages("BSDA")
library("BSDA")
z.test(data_cleaned$GPA, 
       mu = 2, sigma.x =sd(data_cleaned$GPA), 
       conf.level = 0.95, alternative = "two.sided")
```
- Reject H₀ and accept alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 2
- Coinfidence Interval: [ 5.258548 - 6.818375 ]

```{r}
# Case (2)- one Side (Right tail)
z.test(data_cleaned$GPA, 
       mu = 2, sigma.x =sd(data_cleaned$GPA), 
       conf.level = 0.95, alternative = "greater")

```
- Reject H₀ and accept alternative hypothesis: true mean greater than 2
- Coinfidence Interval: [ 5.383938 - infinity ]

```{r}
# Case (3)- one Side (left tail)
z.test(data_cleaned$GPA, 
       mu = 2, sigma.x =sd(data_cleaned$GPA), 
       conf.level = 0.95, alternative = "greater")
```
- Reject H₀ and accept alternative hypothesis: true mean greater than 2
- Coinfidence Interval: [ 5.383938 - infinity ]

# A common test to begin with is the t-test, depending on the nature of the data.

```{r}
# One-sample t-test to test if the mean GPA is significantly different from 6.0
t_test_result <- t.test(data_cleaned$GPA, mu = 6.0)
t_test_result
```
- The p-value of 0.9234 is much greater than the typical significance level of 0.05. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
- This means there is no significant evidence to suggest that the true mean of GPA is different from 6.

```{r}
# One-sample t-test for testing if the mean GPA is greater than 6
t_test_result <- t.test(data_cleaned$GPA, mu = 6, alternative = "greater")
t_test_result

```
- Since the p-value (0.4617) is much higher than the significance level (0.05), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. 
- This means there isn't sufficient evidence to claim that the mean GPA is greater than 6.


# Regression Analysis
we can explore relationships between variables, such as how stress levels and coping strategies affect academic performance (GPA).
```{r}
ggplot(data_cleaned, aes(x = time_spent_studying, y = frequency_of_coping)) +
  geom_point(color = "darkgreen", size = 2) +  
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", col = "blue", se = TRUE) +  # Add confidence interval with se = TRUE
  labs(title = "Studying Time vs Coping Time",
       x = "Time Spent Studying (Hours)",
       y = "Coping Time (Hours)") +
  theme_minimal()


# Split the dataset by family structure and perform linear regression 
#to Apply regression for each group
family_groups <- split(data_cleaned, data_cleaned$family_structure)
regressions <- lapply(family_groups, function(df) {lm(GPA ~ Stress_levels, data = df)})
lapply(regressions, summary)     # Display summary for each group

```

- There is no strong or significant relationship between stress levels and GPA in the Extended family household.
- Slope: -0.1992 (Negative relationship; as stress levels increase, GPA decreases slightly, but the effect is not significant).

```{r}
# Perform One-Way ANOVA (Example on parents_education_level)
anova_result <- aov(GPA ~ parents_education_level, data = data_cleaned)
summary_anova <- summary(anova_result)
print(summary_anova)

# P-value interpretation
p_value_anova <- summary_anova[[1]][["Pr(>F)"]][1]
if (p_value_anova < 0.05) {
  cat("There is a significant difference in GPA between education level groups.\n")
} else {
  cat("There is no significant difference in GPA between education level groups.\n")
}

```

- The p-value (0.456) is greater than 0.05, which indicates that the differences in GPA between the levels of parents' education level are not statistically significant at the 5% significance level.
- This means that there is no sufficient evidence to conclude that the GPA differs based on parents' education level.
- The variation in GPA scores is mostly due to random chance rather than a significant effect of parents' education level.
- parents_education_level (Between Groups): 22.0 — variability explained by the group differences.

```{r}
# Perform One-Way ANOVA (on gender)
anova_result <- aov(GPA ~ gender, data = data_cleaned)
summary_anova <- summary(anova_result)
print(summary_anova)

# P-value interpretation
p_value_anova <- summary_anova[[1]][["Pr(>F)"]][1]
if (p_value_anova < 0.05) {
  cat("There is a significant difference in GPA between education level groups.\n")
} else {
  cat("There is no significant difference in GPA between education level groups.\n")
}


# Regression analysis:  GPA based on time spent studying
model <- lm(GPA ~ time_spent_studying, data = data_cleaned)
summary(model)
anova_results <- anova(model)
anova_results

```
- There is no significant relationship between time spent studying and GPA.
- The slope coefficient (0.0017) is not significant (p>0.05), and the R-squared value shows that time spent studying explains an insignificant portion of the GPA variance.
- This suggests that factors other than time spent studying are likely influencing GPA.

## **Findings and Insights**  

1️⃣ Family Structure and Its Impact on GPA and Stress
The ANOVA results suggest:

- GPA is not significantly affected by family structure (p = 0.474). This means that students from single-parent, dual-parent, or extended-family households do not show major differences in academic performance.
- Stress levels are also not significantly different across family structures (p = 0.662). This indicates that regardless of family structure, students report similar levels of stress.
- The boxplots visually confirm that there is no clear trend—GPA and stress levels appear to be distributed similarly across different family structures.

> 📌 Key Insight: Family structure does not play a strong role in determining GPA or stress, suggesting that other factors (like personal resilience or support systems) may have a greater impact.



2️⃣ Educational Level and Its Effect on Stress & Coping Strategies
The average stress level varies slightly across different parental education levels. Students whose parents have no formal education or only primary education tend to report higher stress levels, while those whose parents have secondary or higher education report lower stress levels.

- However, the ANOVA results show no significant difference in stress levels (p = 0.775) or coping frequency (p = 0.474) based on parental education.
- The boxplots illustrate that students from all education backgrounds show similar distributions of stress and coping strategies, confirming the statistical results.

> 📌 Key Insight: While parental education level may influence students' perceived stress, it does not statistically determine their stress levels or coping mechanisms.


3️⃣ Access to Digital Resources and Academic Performance
- The mean GPA is highest for students with “Good” or “Limited” access, while students with "Excellent" or "Moderate" access have slightly lower GPAs.

- The ANOVA test (p = 0.543) shows no significant difference in GPA based on digital access levels.
- The boxplot confirms that GPA values are distributed similarly across different levels of digital access, with no clear advantage for students with excellent digital resources.

> 📌 Key Insight: Having better digital access does not necessarily guarantee higher academic performance. This suggests that other factors (e.g., study habits, instructional quality, or personal effort) might play a more crucial role.


4️⃣ Academic Success or Failure: Clustering Students by Stress and Performance
The k-means clustering grouped students into 3 clusters based on their GPA, stress levels, and coping frequency.

- Cluster 1 (32 students): Likely students with moderate GPA and stress levels.

- Cluster 2 (11 students): Could be high-achieving but stressed students.

- Cluster 3 (9 students): Possibly low-GPA, high-stress students.

- The scatter plot shows how stress levels vary among different GPA groups across clusters.

> 📌 Key Insight: There are distinct patterns in how students experience stress and cope with academic challenges, suggesting that stress-coping strategies could be a key factor in academic success or failure rather than external circumstances like family background or digital access.
